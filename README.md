## What is this?

While learning FreeCAD I started to model basic features of Gridfinity Containers for my kitchen drawer. As there is some visible progress now, I want to show it to you and request your feedback.

## Progress

So far we have basic bins (light, normal and filled variant), a box opened on one side and a box for a Spoon.

## Help

Pull requests are welcome, as I want to learn more of FreeCAD please be nice and explain your changes to me. Another Option to help would be Coffee, which I would turn into more work:

## FreeCAD Version

I use the RealThunder/Link version, mainly for multiple solids in one body.
